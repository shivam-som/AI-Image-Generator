# AI-Powered Image Generator

This is an AI-powered image generator application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application allows users to generate images from text prompts, leveraging modern AI image-generation technology.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Conversion**: Users can enter a text prompt, and the AI generates an image based on the description.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on all device sizes for a seamless user experience.
- **Image Gallery**: Save and view generated images in your personal gallery.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login.
- **Scalable Backend**: Efficient backend structure using Express.js and Node.js.
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage with MongoDB.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for creating a dynamic and responsive UI.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the application.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime.
- **Express.js**: Framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **AI API Integration**: Connects to a third-party AI model for image generation (e.g., OpenAI's DALLÂ·E, Stability AI).

### Database
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data and generated image metadata.

### Additional Tools
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user sessions.
- **Cloudinary/AWS S3**: For storing generated images (optional).
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling.
